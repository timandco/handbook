# Communication

As our team is dispersed across cities, communication- and doing it well- is integral to our ability to maintain a productive work-pace.    

Your @timand.co email address is hosted at Gmail but we try to make an effort to keep company communication out of email and in a more rich, documented format, like Asana.  Asana can document tasks, and conversations surrounding these tasks.  

For quick chat, or reaching out to a co-worker directly- we have a Tim + Co slack channel.  Slack has  a desktop, chrome, and mobile app so you can always be in close communication.
