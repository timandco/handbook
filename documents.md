# Documents

We make an effort to securely host all documents in the cloud.  We use a combination of Google Drive, GitHub, and GitBooks to allow for collaborative, version controlled creation of documents involved in Tim + Co. operation. 


## Google Drive

We use Google Drive for editable, disposable documents, and for long term storage of media the company wishes to retain.

When documents are similar with slight variations (like contracts), we create templates using Pages and export to PDF for external use.

## GitHub

We always use source code control. It's like a time machine. We can work in parallel universes of our source code, experimenting without fear of losing work. Roll back if something goes wrong.

Git is an open source code control system written by Linus Torvalds. It's fast and great for working in branches.

We use GitHub for hosting our git repositories.

Sign Up for a GitHub account, and join the @timandco organization.  This will  give you access to our code, as well as issue tracking and provide login access to other web services.  

##  GitBook

This handbook and other public facing company documentation are hosted in a GitHub repository and then edited on GitBook.  GitBook allows for easy, collaborative markdown editing in a simple web app.  

Create an account using your GitHub account and join the @timandco organization to edit company git books.
