# Accounting

We currently use Xero cloud accounting.

## Expenses

Expenses are costs incurred while working on a Tim + Co. project that have been paid for using personal funds.

All expenses are logged in Xero using the Xero mobile app, or by forwarding an attachment to the Xero file browser email address and recording the expense manually.

After logging the expense in Xero, save a pdf copy of the receipt to the Tim + Co. Google Drive in ```tc-financial/tc-expenses``` using the format ```vendor_nameDDMMYY.pdf```.


### Expense Workflow
1. Save receipt to ```tc-financial/tc-expenses``` using the format ```vendor_nameDDMMYY.pdf```
2. Log receipt in Xero against the appropriate account.
3. If reimbursement is needed, receipt will be saved as an expense claim.


***need to clean this section up- add explicit directions for expense claim vs. receipt for reconciliation.***
