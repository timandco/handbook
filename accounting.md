# Accounting

We currently use Xero cloud accounting.

## Expenses

All expenses relative to a Tim + Co project are logged in Xero using the mobile app, or by forwarding an email attachment to the Xero file browser email address and recording the expense manually.

Save pdf copies of invoices to the Tim + Co Google Drive in ```tc-financial/tc-expenses```
