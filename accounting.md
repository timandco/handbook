# Accounting

We currently use Xero cloud accounting.

## Expenses

All expenses relative to a Tim + Co project are logged in Xero using the Xero mobile app, or by forwarding an email attachment to the Xero file browser email address and recording the expense manually.

After logging the expense in Xero, save a pdf copy of the invoice to the Tim + Co. Google Drive in ```tc-financial/tc-expenses``` using the format ```vendor_nameDDMMYY.pdf```.
