# Operations

Running a technology company requires more than great ideas and fast, fancy cars (more on the cars later). This is how we operate on a daily basis. While managing cash flow and taxes can seem trivial, getting them right is vital to our success.  

## Principles

* Automate repetitive tasks.
* Outsource things we are not good at.
* Give everyone "admin" access to as much as possible.
