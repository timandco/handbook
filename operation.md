# Operation

Running a technology business requires more than great ideas and fast, fancy cars (more on the cars later). Managing cash flow and taxes can seem trivial, but getting them right is vital to our success. This is how we operate on a daily basis. 

We utilize several services that make things like bookkeeping, receipts, signatures, and invoicing much easier.

## Principles

Some principles have helped us streamline our operation:

* Automate repetitive tasks.
* Outsource things that we are not good at.
* Give everyone "admin" access to as much as possible.
