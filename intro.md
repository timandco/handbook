# Intro

Welcome to Tim And Co. This is our company handbook that details how we operate on a daily basis.  Our internal processes are documented for the benefit of all collaborating teammates.

This is a living, public document hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/timandco/handbook) that all employees can edit through [GitBooks](http://gitbook.com) with their individual GitHub account.  

It's filled with things we've learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.  The format and content are based largely on the public works provided by [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) and [vaporware](http://vaporwa.re).
